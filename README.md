# Street-View-Image-GenAI

Street-view imagery has become an essential data source in urban studies, widely used in visual perception, environmental exposure and social behavior, offering an unique perspective for evaluating greenery, walkability, safety, and overall streetscape quality. While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), partic- ularly diffusion models, have enabled high-fidelity urban image synthesis, most ex- isting applications focus on predictive tasks. These approaches largely overlook the potential of generative models to support goal-driven, sustainability-aligned design. This study proposes a generative framework that produces street-view images con- ditioned on the Green View Index (GVI). The framework combines a latent diffusion model with ControlNet to enable controllable image generation based on both text prompts and target GVI values. It further incorporates semantic segmentation and object detection to enrich prompt construction. Experiments using Google Street View imagery from two contrasting urban environments—dense Chicago and sprawl- ing Orlando—demonstrate the model’s capacity to generate visually realistic scenes that reflect target GVI levels. The proposed framework offers a novel approach for visualizing greenery scenarios at the street level, contributing to sustainable urban design, participatory planning, and visual communication of environmental goals.
